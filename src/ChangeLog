    Do not assume the data field of an address structure is an aligned pointer.
    
    There is *no* guarantee that it's aligned on a 4-byte boundary, and
    there is *no* guarantee that you can safely dereference an unaligned
    pointer.  See bug 11172 for a crash on Solaris/SPARC caused by those
    assumptions both being false.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 20 00:13:55 2015 -0700

    Simplify the calculation of the time stamp.
    
    The time is calculated based on a 32-bit "seconds since the Epoch" value
    for the start time and a 32-bit delta from that time, in milliseconds.
    We can just split that delta into seconds and milliseconds, add the
    seconds to the start time to get the seconds part of the time stamp, and
    multiply the milliseconds by 1,000,000 to get the nanoseconds part of
    the time stamp.  The only 64-bit arithmetic needed is adding the seconds
    to a 64-bit version of the start time (just in case seconds+start time
    goes past Y2.038K).

    Only add flags to CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD if $CC and $CC_FOR_BUILD are the same.
    
    Otherwise, just because a flag is appropriate for $CC, that doesn't
    necessarily mean it's appropriate for $CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD.
    
    (We don't use CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for many things, so it's probably not
    worth making a lot of effort to throw all the warning flags into it if
    we're cross-compiling; we *do* throw them in for native compilation,
    which is what most developers use and test with, so that should be
    sufficient to let the warnings catch problems with the build tools we're

    Keep a captured-packet count in a capture_session and use that.
    
    Have the count in a cfile_t structure always reflect the actual number
    of packets that have been read from the file, rather than, when doing a
    non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time capture, falsely increasing the
    count in the cfile_t to reflect the number of packets captured but not
    yet read.
    
    Have the status bar base its captured-packet count on the count in the
    capture_session structure, and base the "sorry, no packets were
    captured" message on the count in the capture_session structure, as
    we're no longer using the count in the cfile_t structure to count
    anything in the process of a non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time
    capture.
    
    That way, we preserve the invariant that the "frames" member of a
    cfile_t will be non-null if the "count" member is non-zero, fixing bug
    6217.
    
    It also means we can get rid of cf_set_packet_count(), as we only set
    the count in the capture-file-reading code.

commit 3d19ab7
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Mar 30 11:21:17 2015 -0700

    Work around a Linux bonding driver bug (and the lack of a libpcap workaround).
    
    The bonding driver does not properly handle unknown ioctls; it returns
    ENODEV rather than ENOTSUP, EOPNOTSUPP, ENOTTY, or a "not supported"
    error of that type.  This causes problems detailed in bug 11058.
    
    On Linux, check for bonding devices before checking for monitor-mode
    support.
    
    While we're at it, get rid of a commented-out include of
    CheckCSourceCompiles (it's presumably already been implicitly included
    by other functions that use it).

    Fix buffer overflow in 802.11 decryption
    
    The sha1 function outputs a multiple of 20 bytes while the ptk buffer
    has only a size of 64 bytes. Follow the hint in 802.11i-2004, page 164
    and use an output buffer of 80 octets.
    
    Noticed when running Wireshark with ASAN, on exit it would try to free a
    "next" pointer which was filled with sha1 garbage. It probably got
    triggered via 3f8fbb734915aaf74eb006898e8fabb007afbf48 which made
    AirPDcap responsible for managing its own memory.
